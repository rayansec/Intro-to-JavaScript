## Exersice 1:
(Compute π) You can approximate p by using the following series:
π = 4(1 - 1 / 3 + 1 / 5 - 1 / 7 + 1 / 9 - 1 / 11 + ... + ((-1)i + 1 /  2i - 1))
Write a program that displays the π value for i = 10000, 20000, …, and 100000.

## Exersice 2:
(Display leap years) Write a program that displays all the leap years, 10 per line, from 101 to 2100, separated by exactly one space. Also display the number of
leap years in this period.

## Exersice 3:
(Perfect number) A positive integer is called a perfect number if it is equal to the sum of all of its positive divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is the
first perfect number because 6 = 3 + 2 + 1. The next is 28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 1.  There are four perfect numbers < 10,000. Write a program to find all these four numbers.
